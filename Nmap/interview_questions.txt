# Interview Questions – Task 1

### 1. What is an open port?
A network port that is actively accepting connections.

### 2. How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?
It sends SYN packets (like the first step of a handshake). If SYN-ACK is received → port is open.

### 3. What risks are associated with open ports?
- Unauthorized access  
- Exploitation of services  
- Reconnaissance by attackers  

### 4. Explain TCP vs UDP scanning.
- TCP: Connection-oriented, reliable  
- UDP: Connectionless, no handshake, harder to detect  

### 5. How can open ports be secured?
- Close unused ports  
- Use firewalls  
- Restrict access with ACLs  

### 6. What is a firewall’s role regarding ports?
Blocks/filters traffic to specific ports based on security policies.

### 7. What is a port scan and why do attackers perform it?
A method to identify open ports & services; attackers use it for reconnaissance.

### 8. How does Wireshark complement port scanning?
It captures and analyzes network packets → helps verify scan traffic and detect anomalies.
